## homeHub

This is a webapp that provides a central, shared record of TODO tasks, shopping lists and budgeting information for people that share a home. It was built for personal use, and as a learning exercise.

Homehub was built with Next.js using the app router, React.js and Tailwind CSS, with a MongoDB atlas instance for backend storage.

The app is currently set up ONLY for my personal use, so users that aren't on the whitelist (people who live with me) are unable to register or sign in.
